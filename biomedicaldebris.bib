	abstract = {Abstract The lack of landfill space, public perceptions, the escalating costs of disposal, and other factors have created a controversial environment for the disposal of healthcare waste. In the province of Ontario, a proposal has been made that aims to make Ontario self-sufficient in its management of healthcare waste through the use of regional incineration facilities. This article examines this proposal as well as other available options for Ontario's healthcare facilities.},

	abstract = {The aim was to investigate the fate of injection and monitoring material after its use by diabetic patients in different countries (France, Belgium, Luxemburg, Switzeland and Tunisia). Some suitable containers are available for disposal but little is known about the attitudes of patients and physicians to them. 1 070 questionnaires were completed by patients (age: 50 +/- 18 years; diabetes duration: 15 +/- 11 years; 2.8 +/- 1.1 injections per day) visiting 109 doctors. Injections were done at home (72.6\%), or both at home and at work (26.6\%). At home: needles, syringes, lancets and reagent strips were thrown directly into the bin in 46.9\%, 49.9\%, 52.2\% and 67.6\% of cases, respectively; and in a closed plastic bottle in 29. 6\%, 28.5\%, 28.9\% and 19.9\% of cases, respectively. Specific containers were used in 8.6\% and 6.3\% of cases for needles and syringes, respectively. 62\% of the bottles and containers were thrown directly into the bin, whereas 15.5\% were returned to a pharmacy (4.5\% taken to hospitals, 2.9\% were burned). At work: 63\% of the patients brought their needles and syringes home for disposal, 6.9\% kept suitable containers at work and 30\% threw their materials directly into local bins. We conclude that awareness should be increased and the organization of the collection of used material improved.},

	volume = {5},
	issn = {1462-1843},
	abstract = {To investigate community disposal of contaminated sharps by insulin-treated diabetes mellitus patients, we surveyed 144 patients. Twenty-three (16.0\%) were non-contactable, leaving a study sample of 121, of whom 102 (84.3\%) responded. Among the respondents 93.1\% used lancets and 97.1\% needles; 70.6\% used lancets once or twice a day and 65.7\% used needles twice a day. The majority said they had received no information on safe disposal of sharps. Of those recalling advice, most received it from diabetes nurse specialists. The majority of needle users used needle clippers and/or sharps bins for disposal. Most of the lancet users resorted to drinks cans/bottles or domestic waste. There were statistically significant differences in practices between patients receiving and not receiving advice on sharps disposal (odds ratio [{OR]} 6.36 [95\% {CI} 2.04-23.28] p = 0.0007 for needle disposal and {OR} 15.41 [95\% {CI} 3.57-90.12] p = 0.00001 for lancet disposal). There were also statistically significant differences among needle users using and not using needle clippers and/or sharps bins according to the interval since diagnosis and the frequency of needle use per day. This study identifies a need for a standardised approach to sharps disposal supported by an effective method of disseminating information, and a need for advice on auditing its impact.},

Usage was categorised as urine only, faeces only, combined urine and faeces, and other. The urine mode of use followed the expected bimodal pattern of morning and evening peaks, whilst the the number of faecal related flushes peaked only in the morning with no corresponding evening rise. Weekend patterns were shown to differ from week-day usage, particularly in terms of the timing and magnitude of the morning peak. Females were found to use the {WC} 17\% more often than males, whilst males use it 7\% more in faecal related mode. Differences were also established between age groups with elderly people apparently having the highest {WC} usage. The application of cleaning agents was also shown to follow a distinctive diurnal pattern.},

Patients should be advised to either discard sharps into puncture resistant containers placed into their household refuse, or return them in secure containers for disposal by the dispensing institutions. Patients should also be educated regarding health risks associated with used needles. The South African Metabolic and Endocrine ({SEMDSA)} Guidelines and the South African Standard Treatment Guidelines ({STG)} should also give clear guidance on the safe disposal of needles.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} The purpose of this study was to describe syringe disposal practices of individuals with diabetes who take insulin and to investigate the attitude toward and effect of previous information on proper syringe disposal.
{METHODS:} Adult men and women who injected insulin were recruited from an endocrinology practice and given 2 questionnaires concerning syringe disposal practices and attitude toward proper syringe disposal. Completed questionnaires were returned by mail to the investigator. Nonparametric statistical procedures were used to analyze the data.
{RESULTS:} Men with higher income tended to use the trash for syringe disposal more often than lower income men, and older women exhibited a higher positive attitude score than younger women. A positive attitude significantly correlated with the likelihood of proper syringe disposal, and those who had received previous information were more likely to dispose of syringes properly. Healthcare providers were identified as the main source of information.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Diabetes educators can improve the syringe disposal practices of their patients through education at each office visit. Knowing more about the environmental and social problems that may ensue from improper syringe disposal may influence patients to practice better disposal methods.},

A questionnaire survey was undertaken among a random sample population in 250 houses in the nine districts of the island. Results of this study showed an overwhelmingly large proportion of medical waste arising from the domestic environment joins the common municipal solid waste stream and ends in landfills. This improper disposal process poses a serious health hazard to the general public, waste haulers and landfill personnel. It is therefore recommended that a national policy on medical waste management be urgently implemented, proper training of waste haulers be offered and education campaign be carried out to sensitize the general public on safe disposal of medical waste.},
