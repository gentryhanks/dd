The container and used medical waste products are subjected to dry heat treatment at temperatures below the waste material flash points but of sufficient temperature and for a sufficient time to melt the plastic elements as well as to sterilize the contents. During the heating process the metal, rubber and other non-plastic elements remain on the raised insert; whereas, the molten plastic flows through or over the side of the insert to the bottom of the container. Upon cooling the plastic and non-plastic components of the medical waste products are separated as well as being sterile such that the container can be opened and the contents separately handled for appropriate recycling. The dry heat generator conveniently may be placed in a medical office or the like and is microprocessor controlled to obtain the desired end products. The processor additionally controls an electrical interlock system whereby the heat generator unit may not be opened until an entire heat cycle has been completed, and the waste products have cooled to a safe temperature.},

	abstract = {The aim was to investigate the fate of injection and monitoring material after its use by diabetic patients in different countries (France, Belgium, Luxemburg, Switzeland and Tunisia). Some suitable containers are available for disposal but little is known about the attitudes of patients and physicians to them. 1 070 questionnaires were completed by patients (age: 50 +/- 18 years; diabetes duration: 15 +/- 11 years; 2.8 +/- 1.1 injections per day) visiting 109 doctors. Injections were done at home (72.6\%), or both at home and at work (26.6\%). At home: needles, syringes, lancets and reagent strips were thrown directly into the bin in 46.9\%, 49.9\%, 52.2\% and 67.6\% of cases, respectively; and in a closed plastic bottle in 29. 6\%, 28.5\%, 28.9\% and 19.9\% of cases, respectively. Specific containers were used in 8.6\% and 6.3\% of cases for needles and syringes, respectively. 62\% of the bottles and containers were thrown directly into the bin, whereas 15.5\% were returned to a pharmacy (4.5\% taken to hospitals, 2.9\% were burned). At work: 63\% of the patients brought their needles and syringes home for disposal, 6.9\% kept suitable containers at work and 30\% threw their materials directly into local bins. We conclude that awareness should be increased and the organization of the collection of used material improved.},

Twenty-three (16.0\%) were non-contactable, leaving a study sample of 121, of whom 102 (84.3\%) responded. Among the respondents 93.1\% used lancets and 97.1\% needles; 70.6\% used lancets once or twice a day and 65.7\% used needles twice a day. The majority said they had received no information on safe disposal of sharps. Of those recalling advice, most received it from diabetes nurse specialists. The majority of needle users used needle clippers and/or sharps bins for disposal. Most of the lancet users resorted to drinks cans/bottles or domestic waste. There were statistically significant differences in practices between patients receiving and not receiving advice on sharps disposal (odds ratio [{OR]} 6.36 [95\% {CI} 2.04-23.28] p = 0.0007 for needle disposal and {OR} 15.41 [95\% {CI} 3.57-90.12] p = 0.00001 for lancet disposal). There were also statistically significant differences among needle users using and not using needle clippers and/or sharps bins according to the interval since diagnosis and the frequency of needle use per day.

{METHODS:} We conducted a cross-sectional study at diabetic clinics in five tertiary centers in Pakistan. All diabetic patients (type 1/type 2) who were on insulin for more than 1 month, were included. An Urdu (local language)-translated questionnaire was used to collect information on insulin administration equipment, the site and frequency of needle use, insulin syringe/pen/lancet disposal, sharing of needles and knowledge about diseases that are spread by sharing contaminated needles.
{RESULTS:} Of 375 patients, 58\% were female. The mean ({SD)} duration of diabetes was 12.3 (7.3) years, and the duration of insulin use was 4.4 (4.3) years. The majority of the patients used syringes (88.3\%) for insulin administration. Additionally, the majority of the patients disposed of used devices (syringes, 92\%; pens, 75\%; and lancets, 91\%) in the household garbage collection bin. About half of the patients (n=185) reported being educated by their physicians about the disposal of sharps.

{METHODS:} Adult men and women who injected insulin were recruited from an endocrinology practice and given 2 questionnaires concerning syringe disposal practices and attitude toward proper syringe disposal. Completed questionnaires were returned by mail to the investigator. Nonparametric statistical procedures were used to analyze the data.
{RESULTS:} Men with higher income tended to use the trash for syringe disposal more often than lower income men, and older women exhibited a higher positive attitude score than younger women. A positive attitude significantly correlated with the likelihood of proper syringe disposal, and those who had received previous information were more likely to dispose of syringes properly. Healthcare providers were identified as the main source of information.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Diabetes educators can improve the syringe disposal practices of their patients through education at each office visit. Knowing more about the environmental and social problems that may ensue from improper syringe disposal may influence patients to practice better disposal methods.},

While there is a large amount of literature on sharps disposal practices in healthcare settings, the sharps disposal practices of diabetic patients living at home has been poorly documented. This study describes the sharps disposal practices of diabetic patients in South Staffordshire, an English health district. A randomly selected sample of 1,348 adult (aged {\textgreater}or= 16 years) diabetic patients were obtained from the district population-based diabetes register. A self-administered questionnaire was posted to the sample. Non-responders received up to two reminders. A response rate of 91\% was achieved. Household containers were used by: 34.1\% of respondents for syringes; 35.1\% for lancets; and 27.6\% for needles. Sharps boxes were the least used method of sharps disposal. Many respondents indicated that they had received only verbal information on how to dispose of their sharps. Those who recalled receiving information were more likely to dispose of their sharps safely. The results of this study suggest that sharps are disposed of in the most convenient manner, into the household waste.

	abstract = {A medical waste disposal container is made from reclaimed polypropylene in an amount of from greater than 0\% to about 40\% by weight and virgin polypropylene in an amount of from less than 100\% to about 60\% by weight. The medical waste disposal container has a puncture resistance of at least about 2.8 lbsf and an impact strength sufficient to prevent medical waste from escaping from the container. The method for forming medical waste disposal containers utilizing reclaimed plastic includes forming a supply of reclaimed pellets from film scraps of a first resin. The reclaimed pellets are combined with virgin pellets of a second resin to form a blend of pellets where the first resin is different from the second resin. The containers are formed by injection molding the blend of pellets.},

	abstract = {This study was carried out to evaluate home-generated medical waste in Mauritius. A questionnaire survey was undertaken among a random sample population in 250 houses in the nine districts of the island. Results of this study showed an overwhelmingly large proportion of medical waste arising from the domestic environment joins the common municipal solid waste stream and ends in landfills. This improper disposal process poses a serious health hazard to the general public, waste haulers and landfill personnel. It is therefore recommended that a national policy on medical waste management be urgently implemented, proper training of waste haulers be offered and education campaign be carried out to sensitize the general public on safe disposal of medical waste.},

	issn = {0268-3768, 1433-3015},
	shorttitle = {Handling {WEEE} waste flows},
	abstract = {This paper explores the present and future magnitude of global waste of electrical and electronic equipment flows, and investigates desirable changes in these flows from a sustainable development point of view. Quantitative estimates of present and future e-waste flows between global regions, generating, and processing waste are presented and their driving forces are analyzed. Global e-waste production by households exceeded an annual amount of 20 million tons in 2005. Domestic e-waste generation in China has already climbed dramatically, now equalling the amount generated in Japan. China is second in the world after the {USA} in landfilling and incineration of e-waste residues. Absolute volumes of recycled e-waste are largest in the {EU}, followed by Japan. After a period characterized by national disposal practices, a period of global low-level recovery practices has emerged. The paper analyzes exogenous factors, including legislating promoting extended producer responsibility, which are favoring as a next step regionalizing of (reverse) supply chains. Examples on a business level are discussed and critical success factors for applying regional high-level recovery are identified. The analysis shows that in the coming decades, two options will compete on a global scale: (1) a further expansion of the present low-level recovery system of e-waste recycling, and (2) a regional approach with higher level recovery applications. The authors argue that putting businesses, more specifically, the original equipment manufacturers, instead of legislators in the driver seat, will strengthen the opportunities for high-level recovery.},

Interest does not stop at impact of the device, but also includes associated pharmaceutical agents. Across the spectrum of health care, providers as well as end users of products are assessing the impact of product design and contents upon land, air, and water. In this issue of Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Pf{\"u}tzner and colleagues tackle the issue by focusing on a product for the diabetes patient. As environmental sustainability has become part of the evaluation process of many products, their assessment sheds some interesting light on the impact of a group of devices when compared and contrasted against the ever-popular disposable coffee cup or beer/soda aluminum can. Regional variations in waste disposal practices need to be understood when conducting these types of assessments.},
